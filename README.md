# OCaml_Programiranje1

This repository contains various exercises for the OCaml programming language for the Programiranje 1 course (Programming 1).
Topics covered are the basics of syntax, functional programming, modules, functors, custom types etc. In the /game/ subdirectory there is even a commandline implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe with a separate module file and a module signature file.

Some exercises are not finished but I will get around to doing them eventually (probably at least some of them).
